<p>Many people had different varieties of cars that they always dreamed of.  I personally have always wanted the GTI, and finally was able to purchase one back in April.  This car is one of my favorites due to the amount of addons you can put on it, it's like a LEGO.  Below I will list all the modifications I've done to the car.  Once you go down the list you can definitely tell I put some money into it.</p>
<p><strong>NOTE:</strong> I am still finding new things and have a bunch of modifications I would like to do it.</p>
